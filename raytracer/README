***To build this program***

Running 'make' produces an executable called Raytracer.  The only external
dependency of this program is SDL2, for which CMake should resolve at least the
proper linker options.  The location of the SDL2 header files may vary between
installations, so if the header files are not found you may want to try running
the included alt-sdl-path.sh script.

***To use this program***
The program first draws an empty scene, followed by a scene populated with
objects specified in the code. Images that take more than ten seconds to render
will print percentages to stdout, indicating their progress.  Once the second
scene is rendered, you may click the body of the window to close the program, or
press s to save a bitmap image of the screen.  Since scene parameters are
controlled in the code, images of different scenes or different parameters are
obtained by either modifying the code or checking out another branch.  The
master branch renders the default scene with no depth of field effects.
